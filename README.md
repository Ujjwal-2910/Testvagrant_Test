<h3>Class</h3>

I have made a class named "Shopping Cart" which has the properties
- product
- unitPrice
- GST
- Quantity

<h3>Steps</h3>

- First of all, I have created 4 objects given in the assignment
- Then reduced the 5% to more than or equal to 500
- Then found the product for which we paid the maximum GST amount
- At last, calculated the total amount to be paid to the shop-keeper
